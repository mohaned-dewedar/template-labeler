# Sift Cropper

Sift Cropper
üß† Why Am I Creating This?
This project is a personal learning exercise in image processing, web development, and machine learning. The core motivation is to automatically crop maps from recorded gameplay videos using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm.

Instead of manually cropping the map or relying on users to provide coordinates (which may not be feasible if HUDs are customized), this tool helps automate the cropping process. Over time, I realized this could also serve as a semi-automatic object detection/labelling tool, where users review and accept or reject SIFT-detected bounding boxes‚Äîreducing manual annotation work.
